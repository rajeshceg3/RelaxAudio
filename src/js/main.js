    // The SoundscapePlayer element is already in index.html.

    // AudioController instantiation, sound loading, and event listeners.

    // could go here. For now, it's mainly about defining the elements.

    console.log('Soundscape application initialized and custom elements defined.');

    // Potential future global error handling or setup:
    // For instance, if SoundscapePlayer fails to initialize AudioController
    // due to Web Audio API issues, it should update its own status display.
    // If SoundscapePlayer element itself is missing or fails catastrophically
    // (e.g., its class is not defined), that would be a different kind of error
    // that might be caught here or simply result in a non-functional page.
});

// All previous logic related to:
// - Direct DOM element selections (soundButtonsContainer, volumeSlider, playbackStatusDiv)
// - Event listeners for old buttons and slider
// - UI update functions (updatePlaybackStatus, updateActiveButton)
// - Direct AudioController instantiation and preloading
// - localStorage volume logic
// - ESC key listener for pausing
// has been removed as these responsibilities are now encapsulated within the custom elements,
// primarily SoundscapePlayer.js.
// SoundscapePlayer.js handles its own AudioController, sound buttons, volume slider,
// status display, and localStorage for volume.
// Error handling related to Web Audio API is also expected to be managed within SoundscapePlayer.
// The main.js script is now primarily responsible for importing and defining the custom elements.
// The application starts when the <soundscape-player> element in index.html is processed by the browser.
// Its connectedCallback method kicks off its internal logic.
